## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the API route by modifying `app/api/hello/route.ts`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
