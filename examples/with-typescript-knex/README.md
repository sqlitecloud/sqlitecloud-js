## Getting Started

This example shows how you can use @sqlitecloud/drivers with [Knex](https://knexjs.org/), a SQL query builder for Javascript.

You can launch example.ts from VS Code "Run and Debug" menu which will launch node.

You can also use this example to try @sqlitecloud/drivers using bun:

```
bun example.ts
```
